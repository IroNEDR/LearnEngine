Just a fun little project to learn about game and game engine development using SDL and OpenGL following the Youtube tutorial series by MakingGamesWithBen which I found on the [SDL Tutorials Wiki page](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Tutorials).


## Setup
Windows Only

1. Run `make clean` to setup everything
2. Run `make build`
3. The executable will be written to `build/app/Release/LearnEngine.exe`
